# Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation

Given an array of integers and a target sum,
determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target.
Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.
# Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation
Step 1: Check if the length of the string is divisible by 15. If true, reverse the string and then replace each character with its ASCII code.
Step 2: If the string's length is not divisible by 15, check if it is divisible by 5. If true, replace each character with its ASCII code.
Step 3: If the string's length is not divisible by 5, check if it is divisible by 3. If true, reverse the string.
Step 4: If none of the above conditions are met, return the original string.
